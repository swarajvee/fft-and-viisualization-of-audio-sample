# fft-and-viisualization-of-audio-sample using python

In this project, I used a tkinter dialogue box and librosa to extract fft and display the audio sample.

install all the necesssary python packages.

in the pyhon terminal type

pip install librosa
hit enter/return 
pip install tk
hit enter/return

make sure that the audio sample you selected is one that librosa supports.
